# Learn-Kotlin
## New adventure to Kotlin Programming Language
#### This is a shared learning experience, not one reference repository. We deliberately took everything we are learning and we share in this repository, the idea is go from basic to advanced topic.

#### That's include basic algorithms, games and more fun coding.
### Our goal is to 
- Learn
- Teach
- Share

#### With you the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking so that you can pick up consider like a book on any programming language and not feel totally lost. We compile a lot of exercises and basic projects for learning purpose
